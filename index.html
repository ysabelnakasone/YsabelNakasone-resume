        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology and Political Science MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4" <br>I am a second year double major at the University of California, Riverside. I am majoring in Psychology and Political Science with the goal of pursuing graduate school. I am incredibly passionate about my education and am interested in psychological research geared towards child development and family structures, particularly non traditional structures that fall outside of the nuclear family umbrella. I grew up within a very traditional structure and surrounded by similar structures which led me to question and want to know more about changing attitudes and diversity of structure.<br>

        I have previously worked with children as a swim instructor, which required safety training, and that also furthered my interest in different child rearing techniques. It also expanded my interests to teaching since I gained a greater understanding of how children learn and operate in teaching environments. As a professional student, I am already invested in the importance of education but this really solidified the importance of improving and reforming the primary and secondary education system. Political science has always been important to me, being raised by two lawyers. As a part of a generation that is growing more and more active in politics, I was also motivated to learn more and be more aware of the world around me. I have channeled this passion into my position as a staff writer for the UCR publication, The Highlander, and in the future as a member of the Editorial Board. Writing and journalism are the hallmarks of a free people and there is little more important to the survival of genuine democracy than a well informed electorate. Information is the truest power a person can know and I hope to use my degree to further that interest for myself and my community. I also hope to do research regarding racial inequity and institutional racism in America, discovering and rooting out the causes of these crippling issues. The way forward to progress is research and information in a world where people donâ€™t just choose the news they want, they choose the facts they want. I have also learned a lot about responsibility and professionalism as a Student employee with UCR Dining Services. It is a career that has taught me about being dependable and having a sense of urgency. Working there brought me into contact with wonderful people who offered perspective and guidance in essential ways. Growing up in a very privileged environment, I was grateful to have the opportunity to be around people I felt understood the meaning and value of hard work. They, therefore, instilled that understanding in me and made me appreciate my own and othersâ€™ hard work to a greater degree.<br><br>

        In the future, I hope to pursue a career in graduate school, specifically focusing on psychology, and later engage in a teaching post at a higher education institution. I am hopeful that my unbridled passion, dedication, and qualifications will aid me in these endeavors and I encourage you to consider them as well.
